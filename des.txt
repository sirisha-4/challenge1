  I am a passionate web developer with experience in building responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and writing technical blogs to share knowledge with the community.
